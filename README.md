# TraceGuard

## Overview

Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for program analysis, but it suffers from scalability issues. Optimizing its path exploration is crucial for improving efficiency. This project aims to enhance symbolic execution by leveraging taint analysis to prioritize paths originating from memory allocations and user inputs, enabling more effective exploration of relevant program behaviors.

## Project Goals

- Improve symbolic execution efficiency by prioritizing relevant program paths.
- Utilize taint analysis to identify security-critical nodes in the control flow graph (CFG).
- Integrate path prioritization techniques with a symbolic execution engine (e.g., angr).
- Evaluate the optimization effectiveness through comparative analysis.

## Approach

1. **Identification of Relevant Nodes**
   - Use the control flow graph (CFG) to locate memory allocations and user input processing points.
   - Scan for system calls that handle external input.

2. **Taint Analysis & Path Prioritization**
   - Apply taint analysis to track dependencies between input data and program execution paths.
   - Prioritize execution of paths influenced by tainted data.
   - Ignore paths that have no dependency on external inputs.

3. **Integration with Symbolic Execution**
   - Implement prioritization strategies within a symbolic execution engine (e.g., angr).
   - Optimize the exploration process to focus on security-relevant paths.

4. **Evaluation & Benchmarking**
   - Compare the execution results with and without prioritization.
   - Measure runtime improvements, discovered paths, and security vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [angr](https://angr.io/) symbolic execution engine
