\chapter{Future Work}

Some ideas for future work could be:
- Change meta file to actual header file
- Make it work also for ARM and X86 (checking stack and heap arguments)
- Check that it works also for libraries (not only for main function)
- Let the script analyze a complex program (multiple files) and get an output over all (now it only works for one file at a time)
