% TODO: Evtl. already mentioned in background chapter. Here other approaches to symbolic execution, like the Paper: "MACKE: Compositional Analysis of Low-Level Vulnerabilities with Symbolic Execution"

\section{Symbolic Execution Optimization}
\subsection{Path Prioritization Strategies}
% BugRedux, SAGE, KLEE optimizations
% Comparison with coverage-guided approaches

% Concolic execution (SAGE, CUTE)
% Combination of static and dynamic analysis

\section{Taint Analysis in Program Analysis}
\subsection{Static Taint Analysis}
% FlowDroid, SPARTA, commercial tools
% Advantages and limitations

\subsection{Dynamic Taint Analysis}
% TaintDroid, Triton, Intel Pin-based tools
% Performance overhead and precision trade-offs
