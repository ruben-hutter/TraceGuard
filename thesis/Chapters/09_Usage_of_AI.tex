\chapter{Usage of AI}

For the development of this thesis, AI-assisted technologies, specifically large language models, were utilized to enhance various aspects of the writing and research process.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Text Transformation and Fluency:} AI tools were primarily used to refine and transform sections of the text to improve fluency, clarity, and highlight important aspects without altering the original content or technical accuracy. This included rephrasing sentences, improving sentence structure, and ensuring a consistent academic tone.
    \item \textbf{Idea Generation and Structuring:} In the initial phases, AI was employed to brainstorm ideas for different chapters, structure the thesis content logically, and expand on key concepts.
    \item \textbf{Grammar and Spelling Checks:} AI tools assisted in reviewing the thesis for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation issues.
\end{itemize}
