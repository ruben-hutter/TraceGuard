\chapter{Evaluation}

%Compare my work to default angr strategy. Implement a benchmark tool to compare the performance of the taint-guided symbolic execution against the default path exploration strategy in angr. The benchmark should include:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item A set of test programs with known vulnerabilities.
%    \item Metrics for evaluation:
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item Execution time
%        \item Number of paths explored
%        \item Vulnerabilities detected
%        \item Path coverage
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Comparison of results between the taint-guided approach and the default angr strategy.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Design}
\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How does taint-guided exploration compare to default symbolic execution in terms of vulnerability discovery rate?
    \item What is the computational overhead of taint tracking and scoring?
    \item How does the approach scale with program complexity?
    \item What is the effectiveness of different taint source configurations?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coverage Metrics:} Basic block coverage, path coverage
    \item \textbf{Efficiency Metrics:} Time to first vulnerability, total analysis time
    \item \textbf{Effectiveness Metrics:} Number of vulnerabilities found, false positive rate
    \item \textbf{Scalability Metrics:} Memory usage, state explosion control
\end{itemize}

\section{Benchmark Programs}

% Buffer overflows, format string bugs, use-after-free

\subsection{Real-World Programs}
% DARPA CGC binaries
% CVE-documented vulnerable programs
% Open-source utilities with known security issues

\section{Experimental Results}
\subsection{Comparison with Standard Symbolic Execution}
% Tables and graphs comparing TraceGuard vs. default Angr
% Statistical significance testing

\subsection{Ablation Studies}
% Impact of different scoring components
