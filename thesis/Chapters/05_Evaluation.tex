\chapter{Evaluation}

Compare my work to default angr strategy. Implement a benchmark tool to compare the performance of the taint-guided symbolic execution against the default path exploration strategy in angr. The benchmark should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A set of test programs with known vulnerabilities.
    \item Metrics for evaluation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Execution time
        \item Number of paths explored
        \item Vulnerabilities detected
        \item Path coverage
    \end{itemize}
    \item Comparison of results between the taint-guided approach and the default angr strategy.
\end{itemize}
