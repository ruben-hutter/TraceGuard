					<h2> Abstract </h2>
					<p>
In Named Function Networking (NFN) &#955;-calculus enables a programmatic way of inter-
acting with an information-centric network (ICN) as a single computer.
To enable the ICN to understand and handle expressions written in the &#955;-calculus, which
are encoded in names, NFN proposes the integration of an abstract machine that couples
&#946;-reduction with ICN forwarding primitives, and uses ICN as a memory substrate.
The goals of this project are, first to integrate a Call-By-Name Abstract Machine into
the existing CCN-lite implementation. Second, to couple its operation with a forwarding
strategy and thereby combining resolution-distribution of &#955;-expressions across the network.
In the end a NFN capable ICN network will be able to evaluate &#955;-functions and optimize
the location of the evaluation in the network.
Extensions for parallel computing and better load distribution inside the network are devel-
oped to provide a stable and fast execution process of computations.
For testing, native and Omnet experiments are conducted. The functionality of the NFN is
proven in different test scenarios.
